# twitterbot
A twitterbot that retweets specified users

As it is now, addUsers.py reads from a file "riders.txt" with a twitter name in each line, and adds them to a file named "users.txt"
a config file is also needed to connect to twitter. It√§s called twitter_config.json and it looks like this:

{
"CONSUMER_KEY": "your key here",
"CONSUMER_SECRET": "your key here",
"ACCESS_KEY": "your key here",
"ACCESS_SECRET": "your key here"
}
